Over the course of Part 2, I made several important improvements to the Kasi Connect website based on the feedback from Part 1:

HTML Structure Updates

Renamed all files and folders to follow proper web development conventions (e.g., index.html and lowercase folder).

Re-coded all pages using HTML5 semantic elements (header, main, footer) to improve structure and accessibility.

Fixed navigation links across all pages and added highlighting for the active page.

Expanded content to include multiple images, headings, and text sections instead of just one image, ensuring richer, more informative pages.

All text content was saved and archived in the _private folder.

Wireframe and Sitemap Improvements

Updated desktop wireframes to reflect all main sections and content blocks accurately.

Added more detail to the sitemap, showing the order of headings, text, and images for each page.

Goals and Objectives

Revised the website goals to be actionable, with clear objectives linked to each goal. For example, providing digital exposure via categorized service listings and interactive contact options.

Design & User Experience Enhancements

Applied the Kasi Connect brand color (#00c4cc) consistently across headings, cards, buttons, and section highlights.

Improved typography with better font choice, size, weight, and spacing for readability.

Added interactive elements like hover effects on buttons, service cards, and gallery images.

Implemented a responsive layout that adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

CSS Styling Implementation (Part 2)

Created a single external stylesheet (style.css) linked to all pages.

Used Flexbox and CSS Grid to structure content clearly and efficiently.

Added visual enhancements like box shadows, borders, and color highlights.

Implemented responsive images and layouts to ensure the website looks good on any device.

General Improvements

Corrected all Part 1 feedback including folder structure, file naming, semantic HTML, and content richness.

Added complete footers with contact details on all pages for better usability.

Archived all assets and content properly for submission compliance.
